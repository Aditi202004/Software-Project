# Software-Project

## Introduction
The product is designed for measuring the temperature dependence of resistance in various sample materials.
Our software eliminates the need for manual input parameter adjustments on the measuring device.
Unlike conventional experimentation methods that necessitate manual adjustment of input parameters such as
current and voltage on the measuring device, our software eliminates this labor-intensive step while ensuring
precision in data collection.

## Setting Up and Performing the Experiment
- First, check if the connections are proper or not.
- Select the type of experiment you want to perform.
- Accordingly, input the values in the CTC setup.
- Then, input the values in the resistance vs temperature setup.
- After that, click the Sync Set button to set all the values.
- Then, click the Trigger button to begin the experiment.
