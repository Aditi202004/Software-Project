    <h1>Software-Project</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The product is designed for measuring the temperature dependence of resistance in various
    sample materials, our software eliminates the need for manual input parameter adjustments on
    the measuring device. Unlike conventional experimentation methods, that necessitate manual
    adjustment of input parameters such as current and voltage on the measuring device, our
    software eliminates this labor-intensive step while ensuring precision in data collection.</p>

    <h2>Setting Up and Performing the Experiment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First, check if the connections are proper or not.</li>
        <li>Select the type of experiment you want to perform.</li>
        <li>Accordingly, input the values in the CTC setup.</li>
        <li>Then, input the values in the resistance vs temperature setup.</li>
        <li>After that, click the Sync Set button to set all the values.</li>
        <li>Then, click the Trigger button to begin the experiment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other Details</h3>
    <p>If you want to receive an email on completion of the experiment, click the corresponding button. Click the
    Settings button to fill in your email. An email will be sent by the system to you on this email after the
    experiment is completed.</p>
